<h1 style="text-align:center;">Silver Guide (via Varkko - InF edition)</h1>
<p align="justify">In the new AvA, silver is vital. Although we aim to earn the bulk of our silver through AvA actions, it's more important than ever for each player to have a good supply.
Here are my hints and tips for increasing silver. I'm gonna number each one, and give a related explanation in the comments (so those of you averse to long posts can skip through).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=#first>APs - run as often as possible. Levels 70-120 adventures. (Vol 2, Lvl 90 Rescue the Lost Ranger and Vol 4, Lvl 120) are ideal.</a></li>
<li><a href=#second>Buy the AP Talent that doubles silver and the Saddles upgrade from Stables.</a></li>
<li><a href=#third>Sell Unwanted stuff - it stacks up so sell it off.</a></li>
<li><a href=#forth>Experiment with kit, seals and attack type on APs.</a></li>
<li><a href=#fifth>Barter your fellow team members. Get silver, XP and seals.</a></li>
<li><a href=#sixth>Keep a Barter defender posted. Seriously, it's just one CP. No excuses.</a></li>
<li><a href=#seventh>Max the right Barter Talents - the gold talent is well worth the cash.</a></li>
<li><a href=#eighth>Join the Barter Page.</a></li>
<li><a href=#ninth>PtP Swindle our high level inactive target. 60k per day (15x PtP).</a></li>
<li><a href=#tenth>Empty your counting house often.</a></li>
<li><a href=#eleventh>Be careful in the Shop - crafting is cheaper than purchase.</a></li>
<li><a href=#twelveth>Dragons are expensive - try to keep an AvA fund separate from your own supply.</a></li>
</ol>

<div align="justify"><p id="first"><b>1. Adventure Parties</b> - this is the big one. You will struggle for silver if you cannot keep your AP moving. If you have 60-70 CP, there is no reason you cannot make plenty of silver from keeping your AP busy. I have a few tips for this.

</br></br>------ Make sending the AP part of your daily routine. Treat it like you would treat hitting timers for AvA. Pay attention to how long your chosen adventure takes and try to re-send the AP as often as you can. If you have one, this is where a smartphone comes in super handy. My AP runs frequently because I can keep sending it no matter where I go. Its a 5 minute job at most. (On that note, i find that using the phone's browser to enter the game is better than an App, but iOS users may disagree). I know people have busy lives (I do too), but i grab snatched moments here and there to keep that AP running as much as possible and it works.

</br></br>------ Unless you are farming specific resources or gear, choose adventures in the Level 70-120 range. These have the best balance of time, XP and silver. Which you choose depends on your win rate, so experiment with it. If I can get 70-80% success, I'm happy with that. My personal tip is to hit the Crystal Sword adventure (Vol 2, Lvl 90 Rescue the Lost Ranger). It's relatively quick, pays decent silver and those swords remain the best sale item you can farm at 15k per sword. Great to hold in reserve if you need emergency funds. You can also run the Vol 4 Lvl 120 adventure for your fealty and sell the insignia banners from them. </br>

<p id="second"><b>2. Adventure Talents for silver.</b> Buy the AP Talent that doubles silver </br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/L1N8JgO.jpg" alt="AP talent" title="source: imgur.com" /> </br> and the Saddles upgrade from Stables ( +10% more silver from adventures) </br>
<img src="http://imgur.com/mWdzYXm.jpg" alt="Stables talent" title="source: imgur.com" /> </p>
<p id="third"><b>3. Sell the stuff you farm accidentally.</b> When you go hunting specific materials, you invariably pick up other crap that you don't want; Dull Razors, Merchants Boots etc. One that most people will have is Bannermen. When you hunt those Uncommon Gems in Vol 4, you pick up Bannermen by the bus-load too. Sell them off, they just eat your food and chat-up your saltwives otherwise. Also sell off any grey/green boons you have. It's just cluttering up your keep.</p>
<p id="forth"><b>4. When you use the AP for silver earning,</b> experiment with the kit on your MC and the type of attack you use to see what brings the best results. <b>Never use "Send Best" attack.</b> The time differences are too big between different types of attack, which massively reduces the amount of waves you can send. Pick either your strongest attack for your fealty, or put Trade Gear on and send them to Barter. If i'm trying to bring in XP, i use my strongest attack - i win more but get less silver. If i want pure silver, I send them to barter.
</br></br>------ For MC kit, I have found a mixture of speed and power to work well. So either use Barter Attack gear with speed seals on it (e.g Jamie's Hand with Bran the Builders' seals), or choose Trade Speed gear with trade attack seals (e.g. Dany's Whip and Drogo's Belt with Littlefinger's Seals). If that all sounds a bit expensive, Seal of the Seven are great legendary seals for speed that apply to everything, and then there is that little gem the Second Sons seal which boosts silver earned. If you have no speed gear and have to run slow (or if you are a Greyjoy and don't need speed gear for APs as much), using Second Sons seals on your gear is a great way to maximize the silver you earn per wave. They appear to have just been pulled from rotation in the seal shop, but I'm betting they come back. </p>
<p id="fifth"><b>5. Aside from APs - Barter Barter Barter.</b> I know it's a royal pain in the ass, but it has the dual function of providing you AND your chosen target with plenty of silver. You will also drop seals you can use on Garrison rats' open slots to give them a boost, and foster healthy relations with your grateful target! If you combine this with Personal Tactics (Scholars and Squires), your MC will gain a boost to XP. It makes sense to keep bartering in-house, but it can also be a sneaky recruitment tactic if you help decent players.
Barter is all based on net attack and defense combined, plus increased silver modifiers from gear and talents, so use the best Trade gear you have on your main and your defender.
Wins ordinarily get more silver as the net attack and def number determine the available silver pool, then slightly more goes to the winner usually, BUT also - attacker talent from Negotiator will get +40% silver from wins. (See image in section 7)</p>
<p id="sixth"><b>6. Keep a Barter defender up at all times.</b> This is a basic thing. It affects the amount of silver awarded, but I've lost count of how many times I have gone to barter someone and found no defender. When that happens, i just don't send the barters. Sort it out.  Also, if cost is an issue, consider the Seal of the Sept of Baelor on your defender or Barter Defense gear.</p>
<p id="seventh"><b>7. To make Barter worthwhile, please consider buying the Gold Talent for bartering</b> <i>It increases your silver rewards by 40% when maxed.</i> If you don't want to do that, at least make it a priority to fill up your Barter Att/Def Talent and the Talent for increasing how much silver is earned by those that barter you.</br>

<p id="eighth"><b>8. Join our bartering community</b> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1752uZJTfiCQmw6mhzjjT1gjSULuJJo1QrQtQumJIaSo/edit#gid=606309103" target="_blank">here</a>.  You can send some out and call a load back in from others. Enter your name in the spreadsheet, enter your in-game data and the current silver and indicate whether you have just RI-ed or whether you intend to take part in the next AvA. Make sure to keep your best barter defender up, and your best barter gear both on your defender and on your MC. And keep your silver up-to-date, so your alliance mates can see your progress. 

</br></br>You could also join a facebook group called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/118963151770509/?fref=ts" target="_blank">"In Barters We Trust"</a> though it would be much better for the alliance to keep barters in house. Pick the right moments - mid AvA/ Tales or during Triple XP Adventure weeks, you are not going to get much back.</p>

<p id="tenth"><b>10. Sounds dumb, but make sure you empty your counting house often.</b> Once it gets filled, you are losing money by the minute. I empty mine as soon as I see it hit 1000 coins (smartphone comes in handy for me here, too).</br>

If you cannot get into the game for any serious amount of time in a 24 period, but you can grab 5 mins to just log in for your QM keys, make sure you empty the Counting House at the same time.</p>
<p id="eleventh"><b>11. Think about what you buy from the shop.</b> It's more expensive to pick things up in the shop than it is to craft them. E.g., a dream wine is 850 to buy, but only 282 (total) to craft. I tend to buy anything we can use in camps or to craft things for camps, but if your silver is low and we are not desperate for the items, you can save silver by not buying every single thing that appears.</p>
<p id="twelveth"><b>12. Dragons... </b>This one is gonna be contentious, I'm sure, but give some thought to the cost of those scaly beauties. If you are short of silver, dragons are not going to help you build up a supply. It's a very expensive process. If you are calling in Barters from your team mates and then blowing the silver on dragons, you are gonna get keelhauled when AvA comes and you've got nothing to add! Ideal world, I'd like to see people get themselves an AvA Fund, and then only use what they earn above that level for Dragons (yeah yeah, easy for me to say <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VcX3hWB.gif" alt="Tongue Emoticon" /> ). Before you call me a shithead and tell me to F-Off, <i><b>remember that being part of an alliance means pulling together as a team and sometimes making some sacrifices</b></i> (no, that doesn't mean sacrificing me for suggesting this). We can no longer function with just three or four people holding all the silver. <i>If you want to do well in AvA, we need to work this out.</i>
(And I totally accept the argument that a Dragon is a very useful companion for AvA - that's why I suggest mentally keeping a separate fund for AvA and other stuff.)</p></div>
